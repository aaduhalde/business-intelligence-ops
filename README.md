## Data Modeling | Data Pipeline | Analytics

This repository implements a **Business Intelligence and Operational Analytics platform** designed to transform omnichannel communication data into structured datasets for performance analysis and decision making.

The project demonstrates a **production-style data workflow**, including data ingestion, staging, transformation, analytics modeling, and KPI generation.

It simulates how businesses can transform conversations from platforms such as **Instagram, Facebook, and WhatsApp** into actionable insights.

---

# Architecture Overview

The system follows a simplified **data warehouse pipeline** architecture.
```text
Customer Messages (Instagram / Facebook / WhatsApp)
↓
Data Capture (API / Webhook simulation)
↓
Staging Tables
↓
Data Transformation (SQL)
↓
Analytics Tables
↓
Business KPIs
```

The objective is to convert **unstructured conversational data** into **structured analytical datasets**.

# Data Pipeline Layers

### 1. Staging Layer

Raw data ingestion from CSV files simulating messaging platforms.

Tables:

- `staging.conversations`
- `staging.leads`
- `staging.sales`

Purpose:

- preserve raw data
- enable reproducible transformations

---

### 2. Transformation Layer

SQL transformations clean and structure the staging data before loading it into the analytics model.

Examples:

- lead normalization
- sales aggregation
- message classification

---

### 3. Analytics Layer

Structured datasets optimized for analysis.

Example tables:
- analytics.customer_interactions
- analytics.fact_sales
- analytics.dim_leads


These tables power KPI calculations and reporting queries.

---

# Key Business Metrics (KPIs)

The repository includes several analytical queries that simulate business dashboards.

### Channel Message Distribution

Measures interaction volume by channel.

Example output:

| Channel | Messages | % |
|-------|-------|------|
| Instagram | 45 | 45% |
| WhatsApp | 35 | 35% |
| Facebook | 20 | 20% |

---

### Conversion Rate

Measures the percentage of leads that become customers.

---

### Revenue Metrics

Calculates:

- total revenue
- average order value
- revenue trends

---

### Lead Funnel

Tracks customer progression through the sales funnel.

---

# Sample Data

The repository includes synthetic datasets to simulate a real operational environment.

```text
sample-data
├── conversations.csv
├── leads.csv
└── sales.csv
```


These datasets allow the full pipeline to run without external dependencies.

---

# Database

The project is designed to run on:

- **Microsoft SQL Server 2022**

Compatible with:

- Linux
- Local development environments
- Cloud deployments such as Azure SQL.

---

# Use Case
